# Vision Transformer

## What this is about
Just a simple implementation based on the Vision Tranformer paper to understand what the fuss is all about for Transformers without needing to leave the safety of Computer Vision.

## What has been done 
Simple implementation with looping over the Multi-Head.

Will need to find out how to vectorise it with PyTorch.

## How to run 

Make sure you change the directory of your data. I used Flowers102 dataset hence 102 classes. 

```
python -m src.main
```
